## 📊 Interactive Hospital Visitor Insights Dashboard

### 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases an **end-to-end healthcare data analysis solution** built using **Power BI**, designed to uncover meaningful insights from hospital visitor data. The interactive dashboard helps healthcare stakeholders understand **patient demographics, visit patterns, wait times, departmental performance, and satisfaction levels**—supporting data-driven decisions that improve **operational efficiency and patient care quality**.

By leveraging **Power Query, DAX, and data modeling techniques**, this dashboard transforms raw healthcare data into **actionable business intelligence**.

### 🧩 Problem Statement

Healthcare facilities often generate large volumes of visitor and patient data, but this data is frequently underutilized due to the lack of centralized, interactive, and easy-to-understand analytics tools. Hospital administrators and healthcare professionals face challenges such as:

Limited visibility into visitor trends and peak hours

Difficulty analyzing patient wait times and satisfaction levels

Lack of insights into demographics and department-wise demand

Inefficient resource allocation and staffing decisions

Inability to quickly identify operational bottlenecks

Without a data-driven approach, these challenges can lead to long wait times, reduced patient satisfaction, and inefficient hospital operations.
